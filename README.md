# FitTrack-Pro
Personal Fitness &amp; Wellness Dashboard

FitTrack Pro is a modern, visually engaging fitness tracking dashboard built entirely using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It simulates activity logging, meal planning, goal tracking, and weekly insights — all handled on the client side with static data and dynamic UI interactions.
Designed for smooth performance and full compatibility with static hosting platforms.

Project Objective

To develop a clean, interactive, and responsive fitness dashboard that demonstrates client-side logic, DOM manipulation, and UI/UX principles — without any backend, frameworks, or databases.
